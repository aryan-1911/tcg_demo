      <b>Tournaments and Winnings</b>
      <br />
      <span className="text">
        Within the Services, you may enter fee-based tournaments utilizing
        certain competitive multiplayer skill-based games (“Match”). The winner
        of each Match will be determined by their skill in relation to other
        users competing in the same tournament
      </span>
      <br />
      <span className="text">
        As a condition precedent to collecting a prize for winning any
        challenges or tournaments, you may be required to provide information
        reasonably requested by TCG SHOWDOWN and (for prize awards of more than
        $600) information that by law TCG SHOWDOWN requires to enable TCG
        SHOWDOWN preparation and filing of Internal Revenue Service Form
        1099-MISC. CMG and/or any sponsor who provides a particular prize will,
        if required, report the value of the prize to federal and/or state
        taxing authorities.
      </span>
      <br />
      <span className="text">
        You must be at least the minimum legal age required by the state in
        which you reside in order to enter into such Matches. If your state of
        residence does not permit skill-based games to be played for cash or
        prizes, you must not participate in such Matches. TCG SHOWDOWN may at
        any time require you to provide proof of eligibility to participate in a
        Match or withdraw funds.
      </span>
      <br />
      <span className="text">
        The cost of entry and the value of prizes offered in each Match will be
        disclosed prior to the commencement of such tournaments. By submitting
        the Virtual Goods entry fee for any Match, you agree and acknowledge
        that any entry fee paid is non-refundable and that you may not win the
        Match. At the beginning of the Match, any Virtual Goods entry fees paid
        will be removed from the Accounts of any Match participants. Match
        participants are solely responsible for the payment of any entry fees.
      </span>
      <br />
      <span className="text">
        Following the Match, even if the Match closes prematurely, users will
        report Match results to TCG SHOWDOWN within the Services. TCG SHOWDOWN
        will have the sole and absolute discretion to determine the Match
        results and winners, and by participating in any Match, you agree to be
        bound by these determinations. After the Match winner has been
        determined by TCG SHOWDOWN, TCG SHOWDOWN will retain a fee of ten
        percent (10%) of all prize amounts earned by the Match winner, and then
        any remaining prize funds will be deposited as Virtual Goods in the
        Match winner’s Account.
      </span>
      <br />
      <b>Non-Gambling Website.</b>
      <span className="text">
        No gambling is allowed within the Services. The tournaments enabled
        through the Services utilize skill-based games, meaning the outcome of
        all relevant games are based predominantly upon the skill of Match
        participants, not chance. TCG SHOWDOWN does not have knowledge of the
        probability of any particular participant winning a Match and makes no
        representations about an individual user’s chances of winning.

      <br />
      <b>Withdrawal.</b>
      <br />
      <span className="text">
        All sales are final and you acknowledge that TCG Showdown is not
        required to provide a refund for any reason. You will not receive money
        or other compensation for unused virtual goods when an account is
        closed, whether such closure was voluntary or involuntary.
      </span>
      <span className="text">
        Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, within the Services, you may
        request to withdraw Virtual Goods from your Account in the form of "real
        world" money (“Withdrawal”). TCG SHOWDOWN will have sole discretion
        regarding any requests for Virtual Goods Withdrawal. TCG SHOWDOWN
        reserves the right to require proof of your identity when you request a
        Withdrawal, and if such verification is not received then your
        Withdrawal request will be cancelled. All taxes associated with the
        receipt of any Withdrawal are the sole responsibility of the user
        requesting the Withdrawal. Withdrawal privileges will be revoked for
        security purposes when fraud is suspected. If you are permitted to
        Withdraw funds from your Account, payment will be issued based upon the
        manner in which you have purchased Virtual Goods in the past.
      </span>
      <br />
      <b>Disputes.</b>
      <br />
      <span className="text">
        In the event of a dispute regarding the outcome of a Match, TCG SHOWDOWN
        may request that Match participants provide additional evidence,
        including but not limited to photo or video evidence of Match results by
        means of the TCG SHOWDOWN website. If you believe there has been a
        mistake with respect to any distribution of winnings or Withdrawals from
        your Account, please email us at: disputes@tcgshowdown.com. TCG SHOWDOWN
        reserves the right to, in its sole discretion, assess a penalty and
        terminate your Account. If any winnings are mistakenly credited to an
        Account, TCG SHOWDOWN may automatically deduct such Virtual Goods from
        your Account upon discovery of such error.
